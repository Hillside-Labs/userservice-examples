# Find Active Users gRPC

This example demonstrates searching for users based on an attribute value.

In this example we search for users who have a 'last_active' attribute timestamp of less than a certain number of days ago. This value could be set during the user's login or logout so we'll use this attribute to determine when the user was last active on the platform.
